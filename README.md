Here is some multimedia from the paper “A Highly-Accurate Dynamic Graph Representational Learning Model Based on Biased Nonnegative Tensor Ring Factorization” including the dataset, code for the BNTRF algorithm, and a supplementary file.

Note that BNTRF-SF.pdf is a supplementary file to this manuscript. Thank you for your access and reading.

Note that D3.txt is a dataset used in the manuscript. The four numerical values ​​in each row represent (i::j::k::value), where (i, j, k) represents the index in a tensor and "value" represents the value corresponding to this index.

Note that BNTRF.zip is the code of the algorithm BNTRF, which is written in JAVA language and can be run on a computer with JDK environment.

Note that before running the BNTRF algorithm, D3.txt needs to be divided into training set, validation set and test set.
